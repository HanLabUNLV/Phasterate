char* HELP = "\nPROGRAM: dless (Detection of Lineage Specific Selection)\n\
\n\
USAGE: dless [OPTIONS] alignment tree.mod > out.gff\n\
\n\
DESCRIPTION: \n\
\n\
    Attempts to identify elements under selection in all species or in\n\
    some subset of species, based on a multiple alignment and a\n\
    phylo-HMM.  In particular, detects elements that have been under\n\
    selection since the divergence of all species in the given set,\n\
    that were \"born\" on some branch of the tree since their divergence\n\
    and have been under selection since, or that were present in the\n\
    common ancestor but \"died\" (ceased to be under selection) on some\n\
    branch of the tree.  Currently only detects negative selection,\n\
    but extensions to detect positive selection as well are planned.\n\

OPTIONS:\n\
\n\
    --rho, -R <rho>\n\
        (default 0.3)\n\
\n\
    --transitions, -t [~]<mu>,<nu> \n\
        Set the transition probabilities of the two-state HMM using\n\
        the specified values of <mu> and <nu> (both between 0 and 1).\n\
\n\
    --phi, -p [~]<phi>\n\
        (default 0.5)\n\
\n\
    --target-coverage, -C [~]<gamma>\n\
        (Alternative to transitions, use with --expected-length) Set\n\
        the transition parameters such that the expected fraction of\n\
        sites in conserved elements is <gamma> (betwen 0 and 1).  This\n\
        is a *prior* rather than *posterior* expectation and assumes\n\
        stationarity of the state-transition process.  This option\n\
        causes the ratio mu/nu to be fixed at (1-gamma)/gamma, and\n\
        together with --expected-length, completely defines the\n\
        transition probabilities.\n\
\n\
    --expected-length, -E [~]<omega>\n\
        (Alternative to --transitions, use with --target-coverage) Set\n\
        transition probabilities such that the (prior) expected length\n\
        of a conserved element is <omega>.  The parameter mu is set to\n\
        1/omega.\n\
\n\
    --msa-format, -i FASTA|PHYLIP|MPM|MAF|SS\n\
        Alignment format (default is to guess format from file contents).  \n\
	Note that the program msa_view can be used for conversion.\n\
\n\
    --refseq, -M <fname>\n\
        (for use with --msa-format MAF) Read the complete text of the\n\
        reference sequence from <fname> (FASTA format) and combine it\n\
        with the contents of the MAF file to produce a complete,\n\
        ordered representation of the alignment.  The reference\n\
        sequence of the MAF file is assumed to be the one that appears\n\
        first in each block.\n\
\n\
    --refidx, -r <refseq_idx>\n\
        Use coordinate frame of specified sequence in output.  Default\n\
        value is 1, first sequence in alignment; 0 indicates\n\
        coordinate frame of entire multiple alignment.\n\
\n\
    --seqname, -N <name>\n\
        Use specified string for 'seqname' (GFF) or 'chrom' field in\n\
        output file.  Default is obtained from input file name (double\n\
        filename root, e.g., \"chr22\" if input file is \"chr22.35.ss\").\n\
\n\
    --idpref, -P <name>\n\
        Use specified string as prefix of generated ids in output\n\
        file.  Can be used to ensure ids are unique.  Default is\n\
        obtained from input file name (single filename root, e.g.,\n\
        \"chr22.35\" if input file is \"chr22.35.ss\").\n\
\n\
    --indel-model, -I alpha,beta,tau[,alpha2,beta2,tau2]\n\
        Use a simple model of insertions and deletions that assumes a known\n\
        indel history and at most one indel per branch of the tree at any\n\
        given position.  The parameters alpha and beta are rates of\n\
        insertion and deletion, respectively, per expected substitution per\n\
        site, and the parameter tau is approximately the inverse of the\n\
        expected indel length (see indelFit).  If two sets are parameters\n\
        are given the first will be used for nonconserved regions and the\n\
        second for conserved regions.  If --indel-history is not used, a\n\
        history will be inferred on the fly using a simple parsimony\n\
        algorithm.\n\
\n\
    --indel-history, -H <file.ih>\n\
        (for use with --indel-model) Use the specified indel history (see\n\
        indelHistory).\n\
\n\
    --help, -h\n\
        Show this help message and exit.\n\
