USAGE: phyloP [OPTIONS] tree.mod [alignment] > out\n\
\n\
    The phylogenetic model must be in the .mod format produced by the\n\
    phyloFit program.  The alignment file can be in any of several file\n\
    formats (see --msa-format).  No alignment is required with the --null\n\
    option. \n\
\n\
DESCRIPTION:\n\
\n\
    Compute conservation or acceleration p-values based on an alignment and\n\
    a model of neutral evolution.  Will also compute p-values of\n\
    conservation/acceleration in a subtree and in its complementary\n\
    supertree given the whole tree (see --subtree).  P-values can be\n\
    produced for entire input alignments (the default), pre-specified\n\
    intervals within an alignment (see --features), or individual sites\n\
    (see --wig-scores and --base-by-base).\n\
\n\
    The default behavior is to compute a null distribution for the total\n\
    number of substitutions from the tree model, an estimate of the number\n\
    of substitutions that have actually occurred, and the p-value of this\n\
    estimate wrt the null distribution.  These computations are performed\n\
    as described by Siepel, Pollard, and Haussler (2006).  In addition to\n\
    the SPH method, phyloP can compute p-values or\n\
    conservation/acceleration scores using a likelihood ratio test\n\
    (--method LRT), a score-based test (--method SCORE), or a procedure\n\
    similar to that used by GERP (Cooper et al., 2005) (--method GERP).\n\
    These alternative methods are currently supported only with\n\
    --base-by-base, --wig-scores, or --features.\n\
\n\
    The main advantage of the SPH method is that it can provide a complete\n\
    and exact description of distributions over numbers of substitutions.\n\
    However, simulation experiments suggest that the LRT and SCORE methods\n\
    have somewhat better power than SPH for identifying selection,\n\
    especially when the expected number of substitutions is small (e.g.,\n\
    with short branch lengths and/or short intervals/individual sites).\n\
    These two methods are also faster.  They are generally similar to one\n\
    another in power, but in many cases SCORE is considerably faster than\n\
    LRT.  On the other hand, SCORE appears to have slightly less power than\n\
    LRT at low false positive rates, i.e., for cases of extreme selection.\n\
    Thus, when using --base-by-base, --wig-scores, or --features, LRT is\n\
    recommended for most purposes, but SCORE is a good alternative if speed\n\
    is an issue.\n\
\n\
    When computing p-values with the SPH method, the default is to use the\n\
    posterior expected number of substitutions as an estimate of the actual\n\
    number.  This is a conservative estimate, because it is biased toward\n\
    the mean of the null distribution by the prior.  These p-values can be\n\
    made less conservative with --fit-model and more conservative with\n\
    --confidence-interval (see below).\n\
\n\
    PhyloP has been extended to allow compute conservations scores based\n\
    on insertion deletion events using the F84e model. See option -x and\n\
    example 8 below.\n\
\n\
EXAMPLES:\n\
\n\
    1. Using the SPH method, compute and report p-values of conservation\n\
    and acceleration for a given alignment with respect to a neutral model\n\
    of evolution.  Estimated numbers of substitutions are also reported.\n\
\n\
        phyloP neutral.mod alignment.fa > report.txt\n\
\n\
    The file neutral.mod could be produced by running phyloFit on data from\n\
    ancestral repeats or fourfold degenerate sites with an appropriate tree\n\
    topology and substitution model.\n\
\n\
    2. Compute and report p-values of conservation and acceleration for a\n\
    particular subtree of interest (using SPH).\n\
\n\
        phyloP --subtree human-mouse_lemur neutral.mod alignment.fa > report.txt\n\
\n\
    Here human-mouse_lemur denote the most recent common ancestor of human\n\
    and mouse_lemur, which is the node that defines the primate clade in\n\
    this phylogeny.  The tree_doctor program with the --name-ancestors\n\
    option can be used to assign names to ancestral nodes of the tree.\n\
\n\
    3. Describe the complete null distribution over the number of\n\
    substitutions for a 10bp alignment given the specified neutral model\n\
    (using SPH).\n\
\n\
        phyloP --null 10 neutral.mod > null.txt\n\
\n\
    A two-column table is produced with numbers of substitutions and their\n\
    probabilities, up to an appropriate upper limit.\n\
\n\
    4. Describe the complete posterior distribution over the number of\n\
    substitutions in a given alignment (using SPH).\n\
\n\
        phyloP --posterior neutral.mod alignment.fa > posterior.txt\n\
\n\
    5. Compute conservation scores (-log p-values) for each site in an\n\
    alignment and output them in the fixed-step wig format (see\n\
    http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html).  Use the\n\
    likelihood ratio test (LRT) method.\n\
\n\
        phyloP --wig-scores --method LRT neutral.mod alignment.fa > scores.wig\n\
\n\
    The --mode option can be used instead to produce acceleration scores\n\
    (ACC), scores of nonneutrality (NNEUT), or scores that summarize\n\
    conservation and acceleration (CONACC).  The --base-by-base option can\n\
    be used to output additional statistics of interest (estimated scale\n\
    factors, log likelihood ratios, etc.).  As discussed above, several\n\
    arguments to --method are possible.\n\
    \n\
    6. Similarly, compute scores describing lineage-specific conservation\n\
    in primates.\n\
\n\
        phyloP --wig-scores --method LRT --subtree human-mouse_lemur \\\n\
            neutral.mod alignment.fa > scores.wig\n\
\n\
    7. Compute conservation p-values and associated statistics for each\n\
    element in a BED file.  This time use a score test and allow for\n\
    acceleration as well as conservation, flagging elements under\n\
    acceleration by making their p-values negative (CONACC mode).\n\
\n\
        phyloP --features elements.bed --method SCORE --mode CONACC \\\n\
            neutral.mod alignment.fa > element-scores.txt\n\
\n\
    This option can also be used with --subtree.  The --gff-scores option\n\
    can be used to output the original features in GFF format with scores\n\
    equal to -log p.  Note that the input file can be in GFF instead of BED\n\
    format.\n\
\n\
   8. Compute conservation scores for insertion and deletion events. This\n\
   requires a mod file from model F84e and a infoX file. Both can be created\n\
   by PhyloFit using the --subst-mod F84e option. Scores printed represent\n\
   indel scores. See -x flag. Options -r 0 should be used to make sure\n\
   coordinate frame is correct. This option only works for CONACC and LRT,\n\
   With --wig-scores.\n\
\n\
       phyloP -r 0 --wig-scores --mode CONACC --method LRT f84e.mod msa.fa \\\n\
            -x f84e.infoX\n\
\n\
OPTIONS:\n\
\n\
    --msa-format, -i FASTA|PHYLIP|MPM|MAF|SS\n\
        Alignment format (default is to guess format from file contents).\n\
\n\
    --method, -m SPH|LRT|SCORE|GERP\n\
        Method used to compute p-values or conservation/acceleration scores\n\
        (Default SPH).  The likelihood ratio test (LRT) and score test\n\
        (SCORE) compare an alternative model having a free scale parameter\n\
        with the given neutral model, or, if --subtree is used, an\n\
        alternative model having free scale parameters for the supertree\n\
        and subtree with a null model having a single free scale parameter.\n\
        P-values are computed by comparing test statistics with asymptotic\n\
        chi-square null distributions.  The GERP-like method (GERP)\n\
        estimates the number of \"rejected substitutions\" per base by\n\
        comparing the (per-site) maximum likelihood expected number of\n\
        substitutions with the expected number under the neutral model.\n\
        Currently LRT, SCORE, and GERP can be used only with\n\
        --base-by-base, --wig-scores, or --features.\n\
\n\
    --wig-scores, -w\n\
        Compute separate p-values per site, and then compute site-specific\n\
        conservation (acceleration) scores as -log(p).  Output base-by-base\n\
        scores in fixed-step wig format, using the coordinate system of the\n\
        reference sequence (see --refidx).  In GERP mode, outputs rejected\n\
        substitutions per site instead of -log p-values.\n\
\n\
    --base-by-base, -b\n\
        Like --wig-scores, but outputs multiple values per site, in a\n\
        method-dependent way.  With 'SPH', output includes mean and\n\
        variance of posterior distribution, with LRT and SCORE it\n\
        includes the estimated scale factor(s) and test statistics, and\n\
        with GERP it includes the estimated numbers of neutral,\n\
        observed, and rejected substitutions, along with the number of\n\
        species available at each site.\n\
\n\
    --refidx, -r <refseq_idx>\n\
        (for use with --wig-scores or --base-by-base) Use coordinate frame\n\
        of specified sequence in output.  Default value is 1, first\n\
        sequence in alignment; 0 indicates coordinate frame of entire\n\
        multiple alignment.\n\
\n\
    --mode, -o CON|ACC|NNEUT|CONACC\n\
        (For use with --wig-scores, --base-by-base, or --features) Whether\n\
        to compute one-sided p-values so that small p (large -log p)\n\
        indicates unexpected conservation (CON; the default) or\n\
        acceleration (ACC); or two-sided p-values such that small p\n\
        indicates an unexpected departure from neutrality (NNEUT).  The\n\
        fourth option (CONACC) uses positive values (p-values or scores) to\n\
        indicate conservation and negative values to indicate acceleration.\n\
        In GERP mode, CON and CONACC both report the number of rejected\n\
        substitutions R (which may be negative), while ACC reports -R, and\n\
        NNEUT reports abs(R).\n\
\n\
    --features, -f <file>\n\
        Read features from <file> (GFF or BED format) and output a\n\
        table of p-values and related statistics with one row per\n\
        feature.  The features are assumed to use the coordinate frame\n\
        of the first sequence in the alignment.  Not for use with\n\
        --null or --posterior.  See also --gff-scores.\n\
\n\
    --gff-scores, -g\n\
        (For use with features)  Instead of a table, output a GFF and\n\
        assign each feature a score equal to its -log p-value.\n\
\n\
    --subtree, -s <node-name>\n\
        (Not available in GERP mode) Partition the tree into the subtree\n\
        beneath the node whose name is given and the complementary\n\
        supertree, and consider conservation/acceleration in the subtree\n\
        given the supertree.  The branch above the specified node is\n\
        included with the subtree.  Thus, given the tree\n\
        \"((human,chimp)primate,(mouse,rat)rodent)\", the option \"--subtree\n\
        primate\" will create one partition consisting of human, chimp, and\n\
        the branch leading to them, and another partition consisting of the\n\
        rest of the tree; \"--subtree human\" will create one partition\n\
        consisting only of human and the branch leading to it and another\n\
        partition consisting of the rest of the tree.  In 'SPH' mode, a\n\
        reversible substitution model is assumed.\n\
\n\
    --branch, -B <node-name(s)>\n\
        (Not available in GERP or SPH mode).  Like subtree, but partitions\n\
	the tree into the set of named branches (each named by its child\n\
	node), and all the remaining branches.  Then tests for conservation/\n\
	acceleration in the set of named branches relative to the others.\n\
	The argument is a comma-delimited list of child nodes.\n\
\n\
    --chrom, -N <name>\n\
        (Optionally use with --wig-scores or --base-by-base) Chromosome\n\
        name for wig output.  Default is root of multiple alignment\n\
        filename.\n\
\n\
    --log, -l <fname>\n\
        Write log to <fname> describing details of parameter optimization.\n\
        Useful for debugging.  (Warning: may produce large file.)\n\
\n\
    --seed, -d <seed>\n\
        Provide a random number seed, should be an integer >=1.  Random\n\
        numbers are used in some cases to generate starting values for\n\
        optimization.  If not specified will use a seed based on the\n\
	current time.\n\
\n\
    --no-prune,-P\n\
        Do not prune species from tree which are not in alignment.  Rather,\n\
        treat these species as having missing data in the alignment.  Missing\n\
        data does have an effect on the results when --method SPH is used.\n\
\n\
    --help, -h\n\
        Produce this help message.\n\
\n\
\n\
  (Options for SPH mode only)\n\
\n\
    --null, -n <nsites>\n\
        Compute just the null (prior) distribution of the number of\n\
        substitutions, as defined by the tree model and the given\n\
        number of sites, and output as a table.  The 'alignment'\n\
        argument will be ignored.  If used with --subtree, the joint\n\
        distribution over the number of substitutions in the specified\n\
        supertree and subtree will be output instead.\n\
\n\
    --posterior, -p\n\
        Compute just the posterior distribution of the number of\n\
        substitutions, given the alignment and the model, and output\n\
        as a table.  If used with --subtree, the joint distribution\n\
        over the number of substitutions in the specified supertree\n\
        and subtree will be output instead.\n\
\n\
    --fit-model, -F\n\
        Fit model to data before computing posterior distribution, by\n\
        estimating a scale factor for the whole tree or (if --subtree)\n\
        separate scale factors for the specified subtree and supertree.\n\
        Makes p-values less conservative.  This option has no effect with\n\
        --null and currently cannot be used with --features.  It can be\n\
        used with --wig-scores and --base-by-base.\n\
\n\
    --epsilon, -e <val>\n\
        (Default 1e-10 or 1e-6 if --wig-scores or --base-by-base) Threshold\n\
        used in truncating tails of distributions; tail probabilities less\n\
        than this value are discarded.  To get accurate p-values smaller\n\
        than 1e-10, this option will need to be used, at some cost in\n\
        speed.  Note that truncation affects only *right* tails, not left\n\
        tails, so it should be an issue only with p-values of acceleration.\n\
\n\
    --confidence-interval, -c <val>\n\
        Allow for uncertainty in the estimate of the actual number of\n\
        substitutions by using a (central) confidence interval about the\n\
        mean of the specified size (0 < val < 1).  To be conservative, the\n\
        maximum of this interval is used when computing a p-value of\n\
        conservation, and the minimum is used when computing a p-value of\n\
        acceleration.  The variance of the posterior is computed\n\
        exactly, but the confidence interval is based on the assumption\n\
        that the combined distribution will be approximately normal (true\n\
        for large numbers of sites by central limit theorem).\n\
\n\
    --quantiles, -q\n\
        (For use with --null or --posterior) Report quantiles of\n\
        distribution rather than whole distribution.\n\
\n\
    -x <infoXFile>,\n\
        Option required when using F84 or F84e model. The name of the infoX\n\
        file produced by PhyloFit must be given.\n\
