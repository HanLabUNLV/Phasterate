\n\
DESCRIPTION:\n\
    For use with phastCons.  Given phylogenetic models for conserved and\n\
    non-conserved states, the target coverage, and the (prior) expected\n\
    length of a conserved element, compute the relative entropy (H) of the\n\
    phylogenetic models, the expected minimum number of conserved sites\n\
    required to predict conserved element (L_min), the \"phylogenetic\n\
    information threshold\" (PIT = L_min * H), and the expected maximum\n\
    number of nonconserved sites tolerated within a conserved element\n\
    (L_max).  Also will make a recommendation for a new prior expected\n\
    length based on a given target value of L_min*H (see --LminH).\n\
\n\
USAGE: consEntropy [OPTIONS] <target-coverage> <expected-length> \\\n\
            [ <cons.mod> <noncons.mod> ]\n\
\n\
OPTIONS:\n\
    --H, -H <value>\n\
        Instead of computing the relative entropy from two .mod files,\n\
        just use the specified value.  The .mod files aren't required\n\
        in this case.\n\
\n\
    --LminH, -L <value> [or --NH/-N, for backward compatibility]\n\
        Report the expected length that would produce the specified value\n\
        of L_min * H (i.e., the specified PIT), assuming H remains constant\n\
        (it generally won't).  Can be used iteratively to converge on a\n\
        desired PIT.\n\
\n\
    --help, -h\n\
        Print this help message.\n\
\n\
NOTE:\n\
    The relative entropy is currently computed by brute force, i.e.,\n\
    by enumerating all possible labelings of the leaves of the tree.\n\
    This approach won't be feasible with large trees.\n\
